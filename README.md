````
```markdown
...content here...

`````

But make sure to **exclude** the backticks and the `markdown` tag at the start and end.

### âœ… Here's what you should do:

#### **Instead of copying this:**
````markdown
```markdown
# ðŸ“š Daily DSA Practice â€” LeetCode & GeeksforGeeks
...
Happy Coding! ðŸš€
`````

````

#### âœ… **You should copy only this (everything in between):**

```
# ðŸ“š Daily DSA Practice â€” LeetCode & GeeksforGeeks

Welcome to my daily coding practice repository! This collection includes problems automatically synced...
...
Happy Coding! ðŸš€
```

ðŸ‘‰ You can highlight and copy **from the first `# ðŸ“š` all the way to `Happy Coding! ðŸš€`**, and ignore the triple backticks (` ``` `) completely.
