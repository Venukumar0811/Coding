# 📚 Daily DSA Practice — LeetCode & GeeksforGeeks

Welcome to my daily coding practice repository! This collection includes problems automatically synced from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) in both **Java** and **Python**. The goal is consistent problem-solving while building a portfolio of my progress in **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

> 💼 This repository also serves as a showcase for recruiters to view my commitment to programming and algorithmic thinking.
